# CS-330

I approached software design by breaking down complex objects into fundamental shapes and using modular functions. My design process began with planning, where I identified the key components of my scene that included a desk, lamp, and laptop, and I then used structured methods to assemble them. I used shapes like planes, boxes, and cylinders to build more intricate objects. I also implemented various textures, such as metal, leather, and canvas, to enhance realism. Working on this project helped me develop several new design skills. I learned to construct 3D objects from simple shapes and improved my understanding of texture mapping to create realistic surfaces. I learned about interactive scene navigation by implementing user controls. My design process followed a logical progression, including conceptualization and object modeling, followed by texture application, interactivity implementation, and optimization through modular functions. These tactics can be applied to future projects by using modular design principles to improve efficiency and maintainability. This class has given me experience in computational graphics and visualization and has provided me with valuable knowledge that can be applied both educationally and professionally. The skills I developed in graphics programming, modular coding, and real-time rendering is useful for game development, simulations, or data visualization. These skills translate into areas such as UI/UX development, interactive simulations, and data visualization, which align with my goal of transitioning into a career in data analysis.
